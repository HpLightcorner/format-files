# Format All Workspace Files README

Formats all files in the current workspace

* Use:
  * Open command pallette (Ctrl+Shift+P) & enter "Format ALL Workspace Files"
  * Create keybinding to 'editor.action.formatAllWorkspaceFiles' command


## Requirements

Each extension needs a formatter installed for it to work, or else the VSCode formatter will not do anything.
